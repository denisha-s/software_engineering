-The Rock class implements Drawable so it has no interaction and is not an actual game piece in KerPlop. The player can also land on top of the Rock.

-The Snake class extends GamePiece and implements Moveable. The Snake can move randomly 2 spaces and interact with the Player with HIT. The snake is not visible to the player.

-The LostMoney class extends GamPiece and implements Moveable. The LostMoney moves randomly to open spaces and interacts with the player with GET_POINT. This is also the only
way to win on level 2.

-The Black Hole class extends GamePiece and implements Drawable. It interacts with the player with ADVANCE, only if a player is directly next to the black hole (Not on top).

-The Lava Pit class extends GamePiece and implements Drawable. This class interacts with the player with KILL if they are within 2 spaces. If a piece or prize is in the lava, landing on it will kill the player.

-The Gold class extends GamePiece and interacts with the player with GET_POINT. It also interacts using ADVANCE, but only if a player lands on it.
