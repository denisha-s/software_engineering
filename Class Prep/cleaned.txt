1. Two draw methods in piece and title class, tile should be changed for clarity to drawTile. Then also change line 67 in Board class to drawTile as well.

2. The top of each class there should be a short comment block describing the class. Tile class is missing the description of the class. A description of tiles stores tile information.

3. In Piece class, constructor should be before the draw method to follow the general class format.

4. In tile class, line 24 and 25, declaring symbol as string should be before if statement.

5. King attribute should not be public and should be changed to private.

6. In the Tile class on line 13: private constructor Piece piece; should be more descriptive by saying private Piece getPiece;.

7. In Board class on line 9: boardDimension should be in all caps to follow the consistency of NUM_PIECE_ROWS. This should be changed to BOARD_DIMENSION.

8. In board class, variable boardPiecesArrayList is too long and can be condensed to pieceArrayList since it's already defined in board class.

9. In piece class, a comment block describing the draw method is missing. The top of each method there should be a short comment clock descriping the method.

10. In piece and tile class, you can remove int row and int column so there's no duplication and have less code to look at.
